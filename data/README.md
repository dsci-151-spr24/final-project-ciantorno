# Executive Summary


## Introduction/Dataset Background

Every several years, the Rolling Stone magazine puts out a top 500 albums list.  The first one came in 2003, then 2012, and then 2020.  The magazine curates these lists by selecting people in the music industry to vote on which albums should make the top 500 and where each one should be placed.  Each list differs from each other in album placements.  The 2020 list specifically has a completely different top ten then the two that came before it.  Part of this has to do with the voters.  "In 2003, 90% of voters were men. Not surprisingly, voters selected predominantly male performersâ€”nearly 82% of the 500 albums selected were by men. For the 2020 ranking Rolling Stone...expanded the voting group from 269 to 336 and doubled the representation of women voters" (https://pudding.cool/2024/03/greatest-music/).  There were also more voters of color involved in the 2020 list versus the 2003 list.  I hypothesize that this also contributed drastic placement changes in the 2020 list.

## Data Information

The dataset I am using for this presentation, `rolling_stone`, has 691 observations and 21 variables.  The variables are sort_name, clean_name, album rank_2003, rank_2012, rank_2020, differential, release_year,  genre type,  weeks_on_billboard, peak_billboard_position,  spotify_popularity,  spotify_url, artist_member_count,  artist_gender artist_birth_year_sum  debut_album_release_year,  ave_age_at_top_500, and years_between	album_id.

## Research Questions

I have multiple research questions for this project. My first one is, since more women voted in 2020, are there more female artists in the 2020 list than the 2003 list and how many more are there?  My second one is, since more voters of color were added in the 2020 list, does this change reflect a difference in genres in the 2020 list and how did the genres change?  Finally and more specifically, how does the more diverse voting pool, both in terms of gender and race/genre, show in the makeup of each list's top ten?

## Methodology

First, I made separate datasets for each list: `rolling_stone_2003` and `rolling_stone_2020`.  I did this so that I could accurately visualize information that has to do with each list, and not all of the lists at once.  Next, I created some visualizations for the gender distribution of artists on each list.  For my first visualization, I used a bar graph to show the gender distribution of artists on the 2003 list.  Then I made another bar chart to show the gender distribution of artists on the 2020 list to compare the two results.  In order to show more specific data, I then displayed tables of gender counts for each list.  The first ones are only exact numbers, and the second set of tables include percentages as well.  Then, I did the same process, but for genre distribution.  Finally, I wanted to compare the top ten of each list, to show which genres and artists made the top spots.  Specifically, I wanted to show which genders and genres made the top ten.

## Findings

I found that there were more female artists and genres associated with different ethnic/racial groups in the 2020 Rolling Stones top 500 list than the 2003 list.  Between 2003 and 2020, the amount of female artists over doubled, from 7.6%, to 18.6%.  As for genres, between the 2003 and 2020 list, Hip-Hop/Rap albums, a historically Black genre, over doubled.  R&B, Funk, and Latin albums also increased.  Meanwhile, historically white genres either stayed the same, very slightly increased, or decreased on the 2020 list.
